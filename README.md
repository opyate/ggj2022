# Global Game Jam 2022
## Theme: Duality
This game was made at Falmouth University by a team of 5 people for the 2022 Global Game Jam event. For this event, the theme was "Duality".
Our game is a relatively simple puzzle platformer, set on a desk, with level elements made of cardboard. Some platforms may only show up in shadow
